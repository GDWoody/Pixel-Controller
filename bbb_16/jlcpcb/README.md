## BBB 16v2 SMD Controller DIY Instructions
Following the instructions below your boards will arrive with only the SMD components fitted. To complete them you will also need to get and fit the 'Additional Components'.  


## To order BBB 16v2 SMD PCBs:

* Download the  [**Gerber_BBB_16v2_SMD_PCB.zip**](https://github.com/GDWoody/Pixel-Controllers/blob/main/bbb_16/jlcpcb/gerber/Gerber_BBB_16v2_SMD_PCB.zip) file in the jlcpcb\gerber folder.

* Download the  [**BOM_BBB_16v2_SMD_PCB.xlsx**](https://github.com/GDWoody/Pixel-Controllers/blob/main/bbb_16/jlcpcb/assembly/BOM_BBB_16v2_SMD_PCB.xlsx) file in the jlcpcb\assembly folder.

* Download the  [**CPL_BBB_16v2_SMD_PCB.xlsx**](https://github.com/GDWoody/Pixel-Controllers/blob/main/bbb_16/jlcpcb/assembly/CPL_BBB_16v2_SMD_PCB.xlsx) file in the jlcpcb\assembly folder.

*  Goto [**jlcpcb.com**](https://jlcpcb.com), sign in or make a new account, select Instant Quote and Upload the the Gerber_BBB_16v2_SMD_PCB.zip file.

* The default settings should be ok. However you can choose 'PCB Color' and change 'Remove Order Number' to 'Specify a location'.

* Enable the SMD service, 'BOM_BBB_16v2_SMD_PCB.xlsx' is the BOM file and 'CPL_BBB_16v2_SMD_PCB.xlsx' is the CPL file.

* [**See here for detailed PCB ordering instructions from JLCPCB**](https://github.com/GDWoody/Pixel-Controllers/blob/main/JLC_PCB.md)


## Additional Components Required

* Download the [**BOM_BBB_16v2_SMD_PCB_Other_Parts.xlsx**](https://github.com/GDWoody/Pixel-Controllers/blob/main/bbb_16/lcsc/BOM_BBB_16v2_SMD_PCB_Other_Parts.xlsx) file in the lcsc folder.

* Goto [**lcsc.com**](https://lcsc.com), sign in or make a new account and select 'BOM Tool' and upload the BOM_BBB_16v2_SMD_PCB_Other_Parts.xlsx file.

* [**See here for detailed Parts ordering instructions from LCSC**](https://github.com/GDWoody/Pixel-Controllers/blob/main/LCSC.md)
