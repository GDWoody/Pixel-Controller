# DIY Instructions for a BBB 16v2 SMD Controller build


When you recieve your PCB's from JLCPCB they will only have the SMD parts fitted.


![SMD Only](https://github.com/GDWoody/Pixel-Controllers/blob/main/image/BBB_16v2_SMD_Parts_Only.png)


You can now complete the boards with the parts you ordered from LCSC.com

* The upper side
