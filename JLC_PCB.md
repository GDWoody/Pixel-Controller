The next page will confirm all the BOM parts in the SMD XLSX file. Select "Next" to proceed to placement review. If they are incorrect, let me know and I will update the LCSC part numbers.



The final page will confirm all the part placements in the CPL XLSX file. The "dots" should match the pin 1 locations on the IC's. If they are incorrect, let me know and I will update the rotation values.
