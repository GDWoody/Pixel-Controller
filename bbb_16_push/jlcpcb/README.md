## BBB 16v2 SMD Push Fit Controller PCB's and Part Ordering
Following the instructions below your boards will arrive with only the SMD components fitted. To complete them you will also need to get and fit the 'Additional Components'.  


## To order BBB 16v2 SMD Push Fit PCBs From JLCPCB:

* Download the  [**Gerber_BBB_16v2_SMD_Push.zip**](https://github.com/GDWoody/Pixel-Controllers/blob/main/bbb_16_push/jlcpcb/gerber/Gerber_BBB_16v2_SMD_Push.zip) file in the jlcpcb\gerber folder.

* Download the  [**BOM_BBB_16v2_SMD_Push.xlsx**](https://github.com/GDWoody/Pixel-Controllers/blob/main/bbb_16_push/jlcpcb/assembly/BOM_BBB_16v2_SMD_Push.xlsx) file in the jlcpcb\assembly folder.

* Download the  [**CPL_BBB_16v2_SMD_Push.xlsx**](https://github.com/GDWoody/Pixel-Controllers/blob/main/bbb_16_push/jlcpcb/assembly/CPL_BBB_16v2_SMD_Push.xlsx) file in the jlcpcb\assembly folder.

*  Goto [**jlcpcb.com**](https://jlcpcb.com), sign in or make a new account, select Instant Quote and Upload the the Gerber_BBB_16v2_SMD_Push.zip file.

* The default settings should be ok. However you can choose 'PCB Color' and change 'Remove Order Number' to 'Specify a location'.

* Enable the SMD service, 'BOM_BBB_16v2_SMD_Push.xlsx' is the BOM file and 'CPL_BBB_16v2_SMD_Push.xlsx' is the CPL file.
