# BBB All Diff SMD Controller

Customised Pixel Controller based on Scott Hanson's BBB 16v2 SMD controller [https://github.com/computergeek1507/PB_16](https://github.com/computergeek1507/PB_16/blob/master/BBB_16_SMD/README.md). The board is largely the same as Scott's, but with a few modifications.

Note: The BBB 16v2 SMD Controller requires 5v DC only! Connecting any other size power source will damage the board.

# Features

* 5 Differential RJ45 ports

* 2 DMX Serial ports, DMX 1 can be selected as a DMX or LOR port

* 2 GPIO header

* 24 Pin expansion header

* SSD1306 128x64 OLED header

* Onboard 24LC256 eeprom

* Reverse Voltage Protection

* A RTC DS3231 AT24C32 can be connected to the board by either the top header RTC 1 or the under board header RTC 2

* Onboard Resettable Fuse
