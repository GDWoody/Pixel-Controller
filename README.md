# Controllers

These Pixel Controllers are based on Scott Hanson's BBB 16v2 SMD controller [https://github.com/computergeek1507/PB_16](https://github.com/computergeek1507/PB_16/blob/master/BBB_16_SMD/README.md) with a few modifications and are designed as open source DIY hobbyist controllers. They are not intended to be sold as commercial products. All controller boards are 5v DC only and do not supply power for Pixel Strings, only data and ground. They all run FPP to drive the pixel and serial ports. Connection to a network/internet is by ethernet also WIFI and audio are supported via the USB port. All design files are open source and available on github, EasyEDA was used to create the designs.
