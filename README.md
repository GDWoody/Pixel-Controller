# Controllers

These Pixel Controllers are based on Scott Hanson's BBB 16v2 SMD controllers [https://github.com/computergeek1507/PB_16](https://github.com/computergeek1507/PB_16/blob/master/BBB_16_SMD/README.md) with a few modifications and are designed as open source DIY hobbyist controllers. They are not intended to be sold as a commercial product. They all run FPP to drive pixel ports and serial ports. They can connect to a network/internet by ethernet, WIFI and audio is supported over the USB port. All design files are open source and available on github. EasyEDA was used to create the designs.
